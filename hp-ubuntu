# | Usage: ./hp-ubuntu <port>                                                  |
# |   <port> should be a value between 1-65535                                 |
# |                                                                            |
# | Description: Uses netcat to set up a listener on a specified port. If a    |
# |   host makes a full TCP connection (3-WHS) on this port, then add an       |
# |   iptables rule to block all traffic from that host. The idea is to        |
# |   blacklist hosts that are connecting to ports that they have no legitimate|
# |   reason to connect to.                                                    |
# |                                                                            |
# |   Some metadata is logged to list.csv                                      |
# |                                                                            |
# |   Updated iptables rules are written to /etc/iptables.rules                |
